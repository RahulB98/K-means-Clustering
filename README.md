# K-means-Clustering
Unsupervised ML application<br>
This repository contains the jupyter notebook and data file for performing prediction for the insights of data using the K-means clustering algorithm.<br>
### K-Means Clustering Algorithm:
the K-means clustering algorithm is an iterative process to find the intuition about the structure of data; producing the valid subgrouping of data points for a particular data set.
For further explanation about the K-means algorithm, refer the jupyter notebook and go through the code walkthrough hosted on Youtube by the following link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgut-_FmaPg"
